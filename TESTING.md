# TESTING

## Manual Testing

Testing was done throughout site development, for each feature before it was merged into the master file.

Usability was tested with the below user acceptance testing to ensure testing from different users, on different devices and browsers to ensure issues were caught and where possible fixed during development. However, it was noticed that in Chinese browsers (Breeno, QQ, etc) there was some difficulty with the testing, as the browser would not be able to display React components correctly.

## Code Validation

### HTML Validation:

- No errors or warnings were found when passing through the official [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) validator. This checking was done manually by copying the view page source code (Ctrl+U) and pasting it into the validator for logged in user and the rest of the pages were checked by the URL validation.
- ![validator w3 html](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a75abc84-2c0d-4cf3-840c-ffb81df2362b)


### CSS Validation:

- Full CSS Validation Report
- ![jigsaw w3 css](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/218a97ca-af54-4c85-b90a-395dcc64401b)

- For css validation I have used the official [W3C (Jigsaw)](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_uri) validator

### JS Validation:

- Since the application's frontend is written in React, I could not use the JSHint validator to validate the application. As you can down below, JSHint just doesn't understand JSX syntax.

 ![js validator](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f9ac5a2-25b4-4d91-8119-34c44a265284)


- But React itself validates the code on each build, and if there were any errors, the application would not be able to run.
- Since it runs correctly, we can consider all the code to be valid.



### Python Validation:

- Full Python Validation Report
- ![ pep8 auth_password_validators](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc2012c3-f01c-4012-8dd4-93b2ec903f8e)

According to the reports, the code is [Pep 8-compliant](https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). This checking was done manually by copying python code and pasting it into the pep8ci validator.

- errors only found in settings.py
- E501 line too long (91 > 79 characters) - `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS` (x4)

- All other files show no errors

- For python validation I have used the official [Pep8Online](http://pep8online.com/) validator
